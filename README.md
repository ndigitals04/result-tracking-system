# Result Tracking System for University students and Parents.
<p>Parents have no direct access to their children results. They have to wait for their children to send it to them and that is not guaranteed as the children may not want to because of their performance. Students have to see their Exam officers directly anytime they need to check their results. Such process is time consuming and hectic for both the Students and the Exam officers. This project developed a result tracking system to solve these problems. Object Oriented Analysis and Design Methodology was used to analyze and design the system using various UML diagrams. The project was implemented on a Windows 10 operating system using Visual Studio Code as the IDE.  MySQL was used to handle the database. HTML, CSS, Python and the Django framework were the languages used to develop the system. The system would be beneficial to Students, Parents or Guardians and the Examination Officer</p>
